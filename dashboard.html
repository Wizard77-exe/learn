            <h1 style="font-family: Orbitron, sans-serif; font-size: 4em; text-align: center;color:#e6edf3;">HELLO, YOU
                DUMB SHIT!
            </h1>
            <p style="font-family: space grotesk, sans-serif; font-size: 1em; text-align: justify;color:#8b949e;">
                This started as something I built for fun, but somewhere along the way it turned into something
                dangerously useful. The tutorials here are insanely genuine and real. No copy-paste garbage. No recycled
                blog nonsense. No fake “10x developer” motivational fluff written by someone who’s never touched a
                debugger. I actually study the topics, break them apart, test them, break them again, and then explain
                them in a way that even a DUMB SHIT like you can understand without having a mental breakdown. I’m not a
                genius. I don’t know everything. But I know how to research properly, think deeply, and simplify
                complicated ideas until they stop looking scary. That’s the difference.

                If you think coding is just typing pretty words like <code>int x = 5;</code> and magically things
                happen, you’re already behind. You won’t be good enough until you understand that your code runs inside
                a CPU as an assembly instructions like <code>mov eax, 1</code> and <code>add eax, 2</code>
                gets translated into raw binary like <code>10101010 11001100 00001111</code>, and eventually becomes electrical
                signals flipping transistors inside silicon. Even something as “simple” as printing Hello World becomes
                low-level instructions like:

                <br><br><code style="color:#f91863;font-family: fira code, monospace;">
section .data<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;msg db "Hello, world!", 10<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;len equ $ - msg<br><br>
section .text<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;global _start<br><br>
_start:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mov rax, 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mov rdi, 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mov rsi, msg<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mov rdx, len<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;syscall<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mov rax, 60<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;xor rdi, rdi<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;syscall
</code><br><br>

                And yes, even that beautiful “Hello, world!” becomes binary like
                <code>01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111</code>. That’s what your code really is. Not magic.
                Not vibes. Not aesthetic VSCode themes. It’s logic, memory, registers, instructions, and electrons
                moving at absurd speeds.

                This place exists to make you dangerous. We don’t memorize syntax here — we understand what happens
                underneath it. We don’t fear complexity — we dismantle it. We don’t pretend to know everything — we
                learn aggressively. If you’re lazy, this site will hurt your ego. If you’re curious, this site will
                upgrade your brain. If you want to actually deserve to call yourself a programmer instead of a
                copy-paste technician, you’re in the right place.

                Now stop scrolling. Stop complaining. Stop saying things are “too hard.” Sit down, focus, and learn like
                your future depends on it — because it probably does.

                Have fun, motherfucker.

                <strong>Rules of the Dojo</strong><br>

                1. You will not copy code without understanding it. If you do, the CPU gods will laugh at you.<br>
                2. You will not say “it just works.” Nothing “just works.” It compiles, allocates memory, executes
                instructions, and manipulates registers.<br>
                3. You will trace your code when it breaks. You will debug like a warrior, not panic like a
                civilian.<br>
                4. You will learn what happens beneath your abstractions — stack, heap, registers, syscalls,
                opcodes.<br>
                5. You will respect the machine. It executes exactly what you tell it. If it fails, that’s on you.<br>
                6. You will not fear binary. <code>01000001</code> is not scary. It’s just the letter A.<br>
                7. You will earn the title “programmer.” It is not given. It is built.

                <strong>Disclaimer for the Sensitive</strong><br>

                If my tone hurts your feelings, good. Growth is uncomfortable. This site is not here to babysit your
                ego. It is here to strengthen your understanding. The sarcasm is intentional. The aggression is
                motivational. The goal is clarity, not comfort.

                If you want sugarcoated tutorials with pastel color palettes and zero depth, there are thousands of
                those online. This is not one of them.

                If you want to understand how your code actually lives inside a machine — welcome.

                <strong>The Oath</strong><br>

                I will not fear complexity.<br>
                I will not worship abstraction blindly.<br>
                I will not copy without comprehension.<br>
                I will understand that my code becomes assembly.<br>
                I will understand that assembly becomes binary.<br>
                I will understand that binary becomes electricity.<br>
                I will become dangerous with knowledge.<br><br>

                By reading this, you have entered the CPU Dojo.
